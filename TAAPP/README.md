Comments to Evaluators:
  I have added a link to the application info page under the courses and applicants drop down in the navbar.
  In that application info, there is an edit button at the bottom that links to the forms page to edit or apply. 


Assignment Specific Write-up:
	For this assignment, I used bootstrap for homepage, edit forms, and application info page. To be specific, I used the col class
	to organize the webpage and also change its position when on a smaller screen. Also using the jumbotron helped create
	a great big opener to the website. 
	The bootstrap components I used for the edit forms page were Select for choosing a state, File Upload for resume, checkboxes
	for accepting terms and conditions, and tooltips for when the user does not fill in information. This tooltip followed a template 
	I got from bootstrap that also required javascript for it to run.
